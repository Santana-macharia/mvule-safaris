== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use this in a widget? =

Just place the shortcode into a text widget. If that doesn't work (it just renders [logo-slider] in text) then that means your theme isn't 'widgetized' which you can fix easily by adding 1 tiny piece of code to your theme functions.php:

`add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');`

Add this code above to fuctions.php between the `<?php` and `?>` tags. A good place would be either at the very top or the very bottom of the file. Once you've done this you should be able to use shortcode in widgets now.

= Can I do multiple slideshows? =

This Free version just does 1 slider. If you want multiple sliders [get Pro version here](http://enigmaplugins.com/plugins/logo-slider-pro/).

= How can I customise the design? =

You can do some basic presentation adjustments via Logo Slider tab on the admin menu. Beyond this, you can completely customise the design using CSS in the Custom CSS field on settings screen.

= The layout is broken =

It's most likely just a matter of tweaking the css. 

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
